// HOW TO PLAY
- Win by eating enough apples to completely fill the board.
- Each apple you eat makes the snake grow from the tail.
- The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or with a wall.
- Use the arrow keys to move in all four directions.
- When the snake moves, the head advances first and each body segment shifts into the position of the segment ahead of it.
- Food spawns randomly on the board. Eat the food to grow longer.
- Avoid hitting walls and your own tail.

// CONTROLS
- Up key (Move up)
- Down key (Move down)
- Left key (Move left)

// KNOWN BUGS
- Pressing two movement keys too quickly can cause the snake to collide with itself before the game updates

- Removed game mode: Teleportation 
- New game mode: Chose the number of apples that appear on the board at once
